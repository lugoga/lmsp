    <h1>About LMSP-Tanzania</h1>
    <p>Local Marine Spatial Planning - Ad Hoc Group of Experts</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Mission & Vision Section -->
  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Local Marine Spatial Planning (LMSP) - Tanzania</strong> initiative is an informal ad hoc group of experts, researchers, practitioners, and professionals dedicated to advancing community-centered marine spatial planning in Tanzania and the Western Indian Ocean region.</p>
    
    <p>Tanzania's coastal waters are among the most biodiverse and economically important marine ecosystems in Africa. From the coral reefs of Zanzibar to the mangrove forests of the Rufiji Delta, these waters support vibrant fishing communities, diverse wildlife, and growing industries like tourism and aquaculture. Yet these resources face mounting pressures—overfishing, climate change, habitat loss, and competing uses. The LMSP initiative emerged from the recognition that local communities, working with government and experts, are best positioned to develop sustainable solutions tailored to their unique context.</p>
    
    <p>We bring together diverse expertise and perspectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>🎓 Academic institutions and research centers</strong> - bringing scientific rigor and data analysis</li>
      <li><strong>🏛️ Government agencies</strong> - fisheries, marine resources, and environmental authorities</li>
      <li><strong>🌿 Conservation organizations and NGOs</strong> - protecting ecosystems and biodiversity</li>
      <li><strong>👥 Community representatives and fishing associations</strong> - sharing local knowledge and priorities</li>
      <li><strong>🤝 Development partners and international organizations</strong> - providing resources and global expertise</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This diverse composition ensures that LMSP solutions are grounded in both scientific evidence and community wisdom, making them more effective and durable.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- What is LMSP Section -->
  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>What is Local Marine Spatial Planning?</h2>
    <p>Imagine a fishing village where traditional fishers, conservation experts, government officials, and tourism operators sit down together to map out their coastal waters. They discuss where fishing should happen, where marine ecosystems need protection, where tourism facilities can be developed, and how to manage conflicts between different ocean users. The result is a collaborative plan—a Marine Spatial Plan—that allows all these activities to coexist sustainably. This is the essence of Local Marine Spatial Planning (LMSP).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Local Marine Spatial Planning (LMSP)</strong> is a place-based approach to ocean and coastal management that integrates the diverse needs and uses of marine spaces while ensuring sustainability. Rather than top-down regulations imposed from distant capitals, LMSP starts with communities and works upward, ensuring that local voices shape the decisions affecting their waters.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #1e3c72; margin: 0 0 15px 0;">🌊 How LMSP Works:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">
        <li><strong>🎯 Centers on communities:</strong> Places local knowledge and community priorities at the heart of planning. Communities know their waters best.</li>
        <li><strong>⚖️ Integrates multiple uses:</strong> Balances fishing, conservation, aquaculture, tourism, energy, and other activities in harmony rather than conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>📊 Is science-informed:</strong> Uses the best available data and research to support decision-making, combining scientific and traditional knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>🔗 Connects local and national:</strong> Links community-level plans to national MSP frameworks and regional initiatives like those across the Western Indian Ocean.</li>
        <li><strong>💪 Enhances stewardship:</strong> Builds local capacity and commitment to ocean care and management, creating long-term sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>Through LMSP, communities gain agency in managing their marine resources, governments improve policy coordination, and ecosystems receive better protection. It's a win-win-win approach that has worked in places across the world, and Tanzania is positioned to become a regional leader.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Vision & Mission Section -->
  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Picture Tanzania's coast in 2030: fishing communities managing their waters with pride and purpose. Young people choosing to stay in fishing villages because livelihoods are secure and diverse. Coral reefs thriving with vibrant fish populations. Mangrove forests protecting coastlines from storms while supporting sustainable seaweed farming. Government agencies coordinating seamlessly on ocean issues. Tourism operators coexisting peacefully with fishers. Communities understanding that protecting their marine environment is protecting their own futures.</p>
    
    <p>This is not fantasy—it's the vision guiding LMSP-Tanzania. We envision coastal communities actively managing and stewarding their marine resources through collaborative, evidence-based Local Marine Spatial Planning that:</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <ul style="margin: 0; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>🐟 <strong>Supports sustainable livelihoods</strong> for fishers and coastal residents while allowing income diversification</li>
        <li>🌿 <strong>Protects critical marine ecosystems and biodiversity</strong> that are irreplaceable and foundational to all ocean economies</li>
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Strengthens governance and institutional coordination</strong> so government agencies work together rather than at cross-purposes</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Builds resilience to environmental and social changes</strong> including climate impacts and market shifts</li>
        <li>💼 <strong>Contributes to the broader ocean economy</strong> and blue growth agenda, creating wealth that benefits local communities first</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>This vision is ambitious, but it's also grounded in reality. Communities across Tanzania have already demonstrated that LMSP works. Our role is to scale these successes and help more communities access the tools, knowledge, and support they need to chart their own marine futures.</p>
