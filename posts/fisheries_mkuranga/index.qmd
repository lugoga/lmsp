Mkuranga District represents a vital node in Tanzania's marine fisheries network, generating substantial economic value while supporting food security for coastal communities. Through comprehensive analysis of catch composition, value generation, and spatial distribution, we uncover the ecosystem services that depend critically on well-managed priority fisheries.

## Geographic and Socioeconomic Context of Mkuranga

### Location and Spatial Setting

Mkuranga District is located in Pwani Region along Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, representing one of the country's most economically productive marine zones. Situated adjacent to the Dar es Salaam metropolitan area, Mkuranga occupies a unique position at the intersection of coastal urban development and traditional fishing communities. The district's coastal geography includes shallow bays, reef systems, and deeper offshore grounds that support diverse fish assemblages. Its proximity to major markets in Dar es Salaam creates both economic opportunities and pressure on fisheries resources.

The district has a diverse ecological ecosystem including coastal wetlands, mangrove systems, and coral reef ecosystems that provide nursery habitat and breeding grounds for commercially important fish species. These coastal habitats directly support the priority fisheries analyzed in this report.

### The Fisheries Sector

Mkuranga's fisheries sector represents a complex socioeconomic system supporting:

- **Artisanal Fisher Communities**: Small-scale, predominantly hand-craft fishers using traditional methods (hand lines, nets, traps) operating from two main landing sites—DOBI and NGANJE
- **Livelihood Base**: An estimated 3,000-5,000 fisher households depend directly on marine fisheries for income and subsistence
- **Supply Chains**: Connection to Dar es Salaam's markets (approximately 50 km from district capital), regional wholesale markets, and export-oriented value chains for premium species
- **Women's Participation**: Significant female involvement in post-harvest activities (fish processing, trading, marketing), though data on gender-disaggregated catches is limited

### Economic Significance

Within Tanzania's broader fisheries economy, Mkuranga holds strategic importance:

- **Regional Production**: One of the highest-productivity fishing districts in Dar es Salaam Region
- **Export Contribution**: Premium species (particularly reef fish and tuna) contribute to Tanzania's high-value seafood exports
- **Food Security**: Small pelagic fisheries provide affordable protein for lower-income coastal and urban populations
- **Employment**: Beyond direct fisher numbers, estimated 2,000+ indirect jobs in processing, trading, and transport sectors

### Ecological Setting

Mkuranga's fisheries depend on three distinct marine ecosystems:

1. **Coral Reef Systems**: Support reef fish species and associated biodiversity; vulnerable to bleaching, sedimentation, and overfishing
2. **Coastal Pelagic Zone**: Nursery grounds for small pelagics and migratory species; influenced by monsoon-driven oceanographic cycles
3. **Deeper Offshore Grounds**: Support tuna and other pelagic species; accessible only during specific seasons and weather conditions

The East African Monsoon system (southeast monsoon June-October, northeast monsoon November-March) strongly influences fishing seasonality, catch composition, and fisher income patterns—a factor evident in annual variations in the data analyzed here. The two major landing sites (DOBI and NGANJE) analyzed in this report each operate under different BMU management structures, which partially explains the distinct fishery compositions observed.

### The Economic Landscape of Mkuranga Fisheries

Our analysis of fishery data from 2016-2024 reveals a district of surprising economic complexity. With **116.8 million TZS** in total ecosystem service value derived from **1.1 million catch units**, Mkuranga's fisheries exemplify the efficiency gaps between high-volume subsistence species and high-value premium products. This district concentrates its fishing activities across just two major landing sites (DOBI and NGANJE) yet utilizes 23 distinct fishing grounds, creating a spatially distributed ecosystem service network that requires nuanced management.

### Understanding Priority Fisheries

The five priority fisheries in Mkuranga each serve distinct ecological and economic roles:

- **Small Pelagic fisheries** provide the volume backbone, delivering 62.4% of total economic value (728.9M TZS) from 99% of catch units. These species—small, fast-growing fish like sardines and anchovies—sustain food security for the poorest communities while supporting export markets.

- **Reef Fish** represents the value multiplier, generating 35.6% of total value (415.5M TZS) while constituting only 9.4% of catch volume. With an average value 27 times higher than small pelagics, reef fish fishing demonstrates the premium pricing for species targeted by higher-income consumers and export markets.

- **Premium Species** (Tuna, Elasmobranch) command exceptional prices—reaching 17,597 and 11,447 TZS per unit respectively—but in much smaller quantities. These species require specific conservation attention given their vulnerability and economic importance.

### The Tale of Two Landing Sites

Mkuranga's fisheries converge at two critical infrastructure points: DOBI and NGANJE landing sites. DOBI dominates ecosystem services, handling 73% of total value, while NGANJE captures the remaining 27%. This concentration reflects both infrastructure capacity and historical fishing patterns, but also represents a vulnerability—any disruption at DOBI would severely impact district-level food and economic security.

The distribution of priority fisheries across these sites reveals different spatial strategies:

- **DOBI Landing Site** handles all five priority fisheries, making it the district's primary ecosystem services hub
- **NGANJE Landing Site** focuses on three priority categories, suggesting specialized markets or fisher communities

This differentiation matters for ecosystem management. DOBI's diversity creates resilience through portfolio diversification, while NGANJE's focus suggests opportunities for targeted conservation and market development.

### Priority and Landing Site Distribution

This table disaggregates ecosystem service value across the district's two major landing sites, revealing both geographic concentration and diversification patterns. DOBI landing site emerges as the dominant hub, handling a disproportionate share of Small Pelagic and Reef Fish catches. Understanding these site-specific compositions is critical for infrastructure planning, market development, and disaster resilience—the concentration of value at one site suggests both efficiency and vulnerability. The data also indicates which priority fisheries have established market pathways at each site, informing recommendations for supply chain diversification.

### Fishing Grounds: The Spatial Foundation of Ecosystem Services

Mkuranga's 23 fishing grounds represent distinct marine ecosystems, each with characteristic species compositions and productivity patterns. Our analysis focused on grounds generating over 100 catch units to understand significant ecosystem service producers.

### Priority Fisheries and Fishing Ground Productivity

Fishing grounds represent the ecological foundation of ecosystem services—distinct marine areas with specific species assemblages, productivity characteristics, and vulnerability profiles. This table maps priority fishery production across Mkuranga's 23 fishing grounds, focusing on those generating over 100 catch units to identify significant ecosystem service producers. The geographic distribution reveals hotspots of biodiversity and economic value: four grounds (Nganje, Kela, Kwale, Dendeni) account for 67% of total ecosystem service value, making them critical priorities for spatial management and conservation. Understanding species composition at each ground is essential for designing effective marine protected areas and sustainable fisheries policies that maintain both ecological integrity and livelihood security.

### The Price Gradient: Why Some Fish Are Worth More

Economic efficiency—value generated per unit of catch—varies dramatically across priority fisheries. This gradient reveals market forces and species characteristics that should inform conservation priorities. Premium species like Tuna command prices 174 times higher than Small Pelagic fish, concentrating economic value and conservation concern on a narrow portfolio of species.

## Conclusion

Mkuranga District's marine fisheries represent a complex ecosystem service network, balancing high-volume subsistence catches with premium species that command exceptional market prices. The district's two primary landing sites—DOBI and NGANJE—serve as critical infrastructure nodes, concentrating both economic value and fishing effort. Spatially, a handful of fishing grounds generate the majority of ecosystem services, highlighting areas for targeted conservation and sustainable management. Effective stewardship of Mkuranga's priority fisheries requires nuanced understanding of these economic and ecological dynamics, ensuring that both livelihoods and marine biodiversity are sustained for future generations.
