This map shows the mainland Pwani region’s land cover at 10m resolution, revealing a complex mosaic of forest (dark green), grasslands (yellow), and agricultural areas (magenta) typical of coastal Tanzania. The fragmented pattern of land cover suggests a history of selective clearing within forested terrain, with agriculture and settlement distributed throughout rather than consolidated into larger blocks.

The donut chart quantifies the areal proportion of each land cover category (excluding water bodies). Forest dominates at approximately 60-70% of terrestrial area, with significant proportions of cropland and grassland indicating active agricultural land use. The inner ring shows the absolute pixel counts while the outer ring displays proportions, revealing both the extent and relative importance of each category for landscape management planning.","key":"fig-mkoani-composition","order":{"number":2,"section":[0,4,1,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Land Cover Composition of Mkuranga District. Compared to Mkoani, Mkuranga shows higher proportions of grassland and a slightly lower forest percentage, suggesting different land use pressures or natural vegetation patterns on the mainland. The composition analysis demonstrates that while forest remains the dominant land cover in both districts, the relative proportions of agricultural and grassland areas differ—information crucial for tailoring district-specific conservation and livelihood strategies within the marine spatial planning framework.","key":"fig-mkuranga-composition","order":{"number":4,"section":[0,4,2,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["understanding-spatial-patterns-in-land-cover","loading-and-preparing-the-data","creating-a-standardized-color-scheme","visualizing-land-cover-maps","mkoani-district","mkuranga-district","key-observations","next-steps"]}
