Values represent area in hectares. Rows indicate 2020 baseline land cover type; columns indicate 2021 outcome. Diagonal values show persistence (no change); off-diagonal values show transitions between categories. Large values in off-diagonal cells indicate active land conversion. For example, the Tree cover→Cropland cell reveals forest clearing for agriculture. The Tree cover→Herbaceous wetland cell suggests forest areas becoming more waterlogged or managed for wetland agriculture.","key":"tbl-transition-matrix","order":{"number":1,"section":[0,5,0,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["understanding-spatial-patterns-in-land-cover","loading-and-preparing-the-data","creating-a-standardized-color-scheme","visualizing-land-cover-maps","understanding-land-cover-transitions","references","spatial-analysis-and-raster-processing","data-visualization","data-manipulation-and-analysis","data-sources"]}
