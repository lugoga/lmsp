Side-by-side satellite imagery classification (10m resolution) shows forest (dark green), cropland (magenta), grassland (yellow), built-up areas (red), and other categories.

Each row shows a specific transition from a 2020 land cover type to a 2021 outcome, with the corresponding area in hectares. This format facilitates filtering to identify specific conversion pathways of interest—for example, finding all areas converted from Forest to Cropland, or from Mangrove to other land cover types.","key":"tbl-transition-matrix-long","order":{"number":2,"section":[0,6,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Land Cover Composition of Mkuranga District","key":"fig-mkuranga-composition","order":{"number":1,"section":[0,4,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Land Cover Transition Matrix for Mkuranga District (2020-2021). Values represent area in hectares. Rows indicate 2020 baseline land cover type; columns indicate 2021 outcome. Diagonal values show persistence (no change); off-diagonal values show transitions between categories. Large values in off-diagonal cells indicate active land conversion. For example, the Tree cover→Cropland cell reveals forest clearing for agriculture. The Mangrove→other transitions reveal changes in this critical coastal habitat.","key":"tbl-transition-matrix","order":{"number":1,"section":[0,6,0,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["understanding-spatial-patterns-in-land-cover","loading-and-preparing-the-data","creating-a-standardized-color-scheme","land-cover-distribution-in-mkuranga-district","visualizing-land-cover-maps","understanding-land-cover-transitions","references","spatial-analysis-and-raster-processing","data-visualization","data-manipulation-and-analysis","data-sources"]}
