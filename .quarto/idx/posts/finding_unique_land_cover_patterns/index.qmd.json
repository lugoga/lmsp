Rather than simply knowing what proportion of an area is forest or cropland, understanding the *pattern* of these land covers reveals much more about ecosystem function and human land use practices. For example, fragmented forests interspersed with agriculture indicate different management histories and conservation challenges than consolidated forest blocks.\n\nSpatial signatures provide a quantitative framework for capturing these patterns. They encode information about how land cover types are spatially organized—whether they form large contiguous patches, are highly fragmented, or follow specific spatial arrangements. In this post, I'll demonstrate how to compare spatial signatures between two coastal Tanzanian districts and use visual analysis to identify their characteristic land cover patterns.\n\n## Loading and Preparing the Data\n\nWorking with spatial raster data requires careful data loading and preprocessing to ensure consistent and accurate analysis. We begin by loading specialized R packages designed for spatial analysis: `terra` for raster operations, `sf` for vector geometries, and `tidyterra` to bridge spatial data with tidyverse workflows. These packages provide efficient tools for reading, manipulating, and visualizing large spatial datasets.\n\nWe source ESA WorldCover 10m resolution land cover data for our study areas. The Mkoani district data covers the Pemba region, while Mkuranga district is defined by a specific geographic extent. Converting these rasters to factors (categorical data) is essential—it tells R that the numeric values represent discrete land cover categories rather than continuous measurements, which enables proper labeling and visualization.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyterra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(webr)\n```\n\nWe'll work with ESA WorldCover 10m resolution land cover data for two districts in Tanzania. The data represent land cover types in a part of Tanzania in 2020 at 10 m resolution. We also load the boundaries of protected areas in the region.\n\n\n```{r}\npemba_lulc = terra::rast('../data/mkoani_lulc_2021.tif') |> \n    as.factor()\n\nmkuranga_lulc = terra::rast('../data/mkuranga_lulc_2021.tif') |> \n    terra::crop(terra::ext(39.2, 39.48, -7.55, -7.1), mask = TRUE) |> \n    as.factor()\n```\n\n## Creating a Standardized Color Scheme\n\nConsistent color representation across all visualizations is crucial for effective communication and reproducibility in scientific analyses. We create a reference dataframe (`worldcover_df`) that maps each ESA WorldCover land cover category to a standardized hex color code based on official ESA specifications. This single reference ensures that forest always appears as dark green (#006400), water as blue (#0064c8), and so forth across all figures.\n\n\n```{r}\n# Based on official ESA WorldCover specifications\nworldcover_df = data.frame(\n  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100),\n  label = c(\"Tree cover\", \"Shrubland\", \"Grassland\", \"Cropland\", \n            \"Built-up\", \"Bare/sparse vegetation\", \"Snow and ice\",\n            \"Water bodies\", \"Herbaceous wetland\", \n            \"Mangroves\", \"Moss and lichen\"),\n  color = c(\"#006400\", \"#ffbb22\", \"#ffff4c\", \"#f096ff\", \"#fa0000\", \n            \"#b4b4b4\", \"#f0f0f0\", \"#0064c8\", \"#0096a0\", \"#00cf75\", \"#fae6a0\")\n)\n\n\n```\n\nBeyond colors, we embed this metadata directly into our raster objects using the `levels()` and `coltab()` functions. This embeds both the categorical labels and color palette into the raster structure itself, making the visualizations self-contained and reproducible. Any downstream analysis or visualization automatically uses these definitions, eliminating inconsistencies and the need to repeatedly specify colors and labels.\n\n```{r}\n# Set levels with labels\nlevels(pemba_lulc) = worldcover_df |> select(value, label)\nlevels(mkuranga_lulc) = worldcover_df |> select(value, label)\n\n# Embed color palette into rasters\ncoltab(pemba_lulc) = worldcover_df |> select(value, color)\ncoltab(mkuranga_lulc) = worldcover_df |> select(value, color)\n```\n\n## Visualizing Land Cover Maps\n\nRaster maps provide an intuitive visual representation of land cover distribution across space. By mapping pixel values to colors using our standardized scheme, we can immediately identify dominant land cover types and their spatial arrangement. The maps below use a minimal theme with subtle axes to keep focus on the spatial patterns themselves rather than chart elements.\n\nThe composition pie charts complement the maps by quantifying the areal proportion of each land cover type. Rather than showing all categories, we exclude water bodies (which often dominate coastal areas due to ocean coverage) to better visualize terrestrial land cover proportions. The start angle adjustment ensures labels are positioned for readability.\n\n### Mkoani District\n\nThe Mkoani district, located on Pemba Island, displays a landscape heavily influenced by its island geography and historical land use patterns. @fig-mkoani-map reveals extensive forest cover interspersed with agricultural areas and coastal features, reflecting a balance between conservation and subsistence livelihoods common in coastal communities.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mkoani-map\n#| fig-cap: \"Land Cover Map of Mkoani District (2021).

However, the spatial arrangement and composition of other land cover types differ between regions, reflecting distinct management histories and development trajectories. The presence of significant agricultural lands alongside forests suggests these areas support mixed subsistence and commercial activities.\n\nThese foundational observations establish the baseline for deeper spatial pattern analysis. Understanding composition alone is insufficient—the *configuration* of these land covers (their fragmentation, connectivity, and spatial arrangement) determines ecosystem resilience and management effectiveness. The next phase of analysis will quantify these spatial patterns using advanced techniques to identify areas of unique land cover organization.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWith these baseline land cover maps and compositions established, we are now positioned to explore more sophisticated spatial analysis techniques. The motif R package provides powerful methods to calculate spatial signatures—quantitative summaries of the local spatial arrangement of land covers. These signatures enable us to compare regions not just by *what* land covers they contain, but by *how* those covers are spatially organized.\n\nFuture analyses will employ spatial signature matching to identify areas with similar land cover patterns, detect changes in spatial organization between time periods, and pinpoint regions with unique or anomalous spatial configurations. These advanced methods reveal landscape-level changes that simple composition analysis cannot capture, enabling more targeted conservation and land management strategies tailored to regional characteristics.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Understanding Spatial Patterns in Land Cover\n\nSpatial patterns in land cover are the local arrangements and configurations of different land use types across a landscape.
