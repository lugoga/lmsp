Our ocean is more than water—it's a source of life, sustenance, and opportunity for millions of coastal communities. Yet without thoughtful planning, we risk losing its treasures to competing interests and unsustainable practices. That's where **Local Marine Spatial Planning (LMSP)** comes in.

We are a collective of passionate experts, researchers, and community leaders working across Tanzania and the Western Indian Ocean to transform how we manage our marine resources. Through evidence-based planning, genuine community engagement, and collaborative governance, we're proving that thriving ecosystems and thriving communities can—and must—go hand in hand.

This isn't just another planning initiative. It's a movement toward **ocean stewardship rooted in local knowledge, scientific rigor, and equitable decision-making**. Every initiative we support, every dataset we share, and every partnership we build is a step toward a sustainable future for our seas and the people who depend on them.
